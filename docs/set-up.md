# Setting up the environment

We are going to prepare a suitable development environment to work with Vue following the next list:

- [ ] Node.js and NPM
- [ ] vue-cli
- [ ] IDE

## Node.js and NPM

Please follow this link to install node and npm in you system.

[Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## vue-cli

Standard Tooling for Vue.js Development [Official site](https://cli.vuejs.org/)

Install:

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

Create a project:

```
vue create my-project
# OR
vue ui
```

## IDE

With the IDE we will have to take a hard decission because there are many IDE's, if you want more speed and customization, VSCode, Sublime Text or Atom are going to have the extensions you need to speed up your Vue workflow. Otherwise, if you can live with the slightly 'slower' aspect of using a full IDE, roll with WebStorm.

So I like the combination of VSCode and the official extension Vetur, here you can download it.
